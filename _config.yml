    description: "To the generation affected by climate change: You can make a difference. 

What if you told an adult...
If you care about my future, you would care about climate change and vote to fight it.
...how would they react?

Letâ€™s change the minds of adults around us by starting the conversation and watching this YouTube video for right leaning adults or that video for left-leaning adults and discuss it with them. Together among the 42 million teens in the US, if we all talk to 3 adults each, we nearly reach the entire voter turnout in the 2016 US Presidential Election."
